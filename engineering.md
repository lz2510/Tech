## What is OOP?

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm where the complete software operates as a bunch of objects talking to each other. An object is a collection of data and methods that operate on its data.

## Advantages of OOP?

The main advantage of OOP is better manageable code that covers following.

1) The overall understanding of the software is increased as the distance between the language spoken by developers and that spoken by users.

2) Object orientation eases maintenance by the use of encapsulation.   One can easily change the underlying representation by keeping the methods same.

OOP paradigm is mainly useful for relatively big software.

## SOLID  

   ### Liskov substitution principle 
   
   To achieve that, your subclasses need to follow these rules: 
   * Donâ€™t implement any stricter validation rules on input parameters than implemented by the parent class. 
   * Apply at the least the same rules to all output parameters as applied by the parent class.

Don't repeat yourself

## the twelve-factor app

I. Codebase  
One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

II. Dependencies  
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

III. Config  
Store config in the environment

IV. Backing services  
Treat backing services as attached resources

V. Build, release, run  
Strictly separate build and run stages

VI. Processes  
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

VII. Port binding  
Export services via port binding

VIII. Concurrency  
Scale out via the process model

IX. Disposability  
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

X. Dev/prod parity  
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

XI. Logs  
Treat logs as event streams

XII. Admin processes  
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
