## Advantages of OOP?

The main advantage of OOP is better manageable code that covers following.

1) The overall understanding of the software is increased as the distance between the language spoken by developers and that spoken by users.

2) Object orientation eases maintenance by the use of encapsulation.   One can easily change the underlying representation by keeping the methods same.

OOP paradigm is mainly useful for relatively big software.

## SOLID  

   ### Liskov substitution principle 
   
   To achieve that, your subclasses need to follow these rules: 
   * Donâ€™t implement any stricter validation rules on input parameters than implemented by the parent class. 
   * Apply at the least the same rules to all output parameters as applied by the parent class.
