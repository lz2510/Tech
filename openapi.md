## What Is OpenAPI?

OpenAPI Specification (formerly known as Swagger Specification) is an open-source format for describing and documenting APIs. It has since become a de-facto standard for designing and describing RESTful APIs, and is used by millions of developers and organizations for developing their APIs, be it internal or client facing.

## format

The latest version of OpenAPI is 3.0. OpenAPI definitions can be written in JSON or YAML. We recommend YAML, because it is easier to read and write.
