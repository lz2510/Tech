# data structure

Abstract data types are implemented by data structures.

## Abstract Data Type(ADT) and Data Structure to implemente ADT 
- String
  - Array (data structrue)
- Array (Data Type or Abstract Data Type)
  - Array (data structure)
- List
  - Linked List
- Stack
  - Linked List
- Queue
  - Linked List
- Map/Associative array
  - Hash table implementation
  - Tree implementation (Self-balancing binary search trees like, such as an AVL tree or a redâ€“black tree)
- Set
  - Hash table
- Tree

## String

String is a abstract data type, not a data structure.
Strings are typically implemented as arrays of bytes, characters, or code units.

### String access and modification by character in PHP

Characters within strings may be accessed and modified by specifying the zero-based offset of the desired character after the string using square array brackets, as in $str[42].

## Associative array (map)

The two major approaches to implementing dictionaries are a hash table or a search tree.

## List (abstract data type)

Lists are typically implemented either as linked lists (either singly or doubly linked) or as arrays.
