# Backtracking

## definition

Backtracking is a class of algorithms for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.[1]

## Backtracking vs DFS

Backtracking is a more general purpose algorithm.

Depth-First search is a specific form of backtracking where the process of backtracking takes place in the leaf nodes.

## example

The classic textbook example of the use of backtracking is the eight queens puzzle. Backtracking is an important tool for solving constraint satisfaction problems,[2] such as crosswords, verbal arithmetic, Sudoku, and many other puzzles.
