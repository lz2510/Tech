# Restful API

## restful

https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/invitations.html

## Get parameter should be put in query string or request boyd?

All remaining request message fields shall map to the URL query parameters. There is no request body;

## path params vs. query params

Best practice for RESTful API design is that path params are used to identify a specific resource or resources, while query parameters are used to sort/filter those resources.

GET /cars
GET /cars/:id

This way you are only using path parameters when you are specifying which resource to fetch, but this does not sort/filter the resources in any way.

Now suppose you wanted to add the capability to filter the cars by color in your GET requests. Because color is not a resource (it is a property of a resource), you could add a query parameter that does this. You would add that query parameter to your GET /cars request like this:

GET /cars?color=blue

This endpoint would be implemented so that only blue cars would be returned.

### Parameter Locations

There are four possible parameter locations specified by the in field:

path - Used together with Path Templating, where the parameter value is actually part of the operationâ€™s URL. This does not include the host or base path of the API. For example, in /items/{itemId}, the path parameter is itemId.

query - Parameters that are appended to the URL. For example, in /items?id=###, the query parameter is id.

header - Custom headers that are expected as part of the request. Note that [RFC7230] states header names are case insensitive.

cookie - Used to pass a specific cookie value to the API.

## Nested collections and properties

Collection items MAY contain other collections. For example, a user collection MAY contain user resources that have multiple addresses:

    GET https://api.contoso.com/v1.0/people/123/addresses

## pagination

### Server-driven paging

Paginated responses MUST indicate a partial result by including a continuation token in the response. The absence of a continuation token means that no additional pages are available.

For example, amazon selling partner uses NextToken to indicate if still has additional pages. And tiktok use more is false or true to do the same thing, but NextToken is safter.

### Client-driven paging

Clients MAY use $start and $offset query parameters to specify a number of results to return and an offset into the collection.
