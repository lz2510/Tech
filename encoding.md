## Character encoding vs code points vs code space

Character encoding is the process of assigning numbers to graphical characters, especially the written characters of human language, allowing them to be stored, transmitted, and transformed using digital computers.[1] The numerical values that make up a character encoding are known as "code points" and collectively comprise a "code space", a "code page", or a "character map".

## Morse code

The earliest well-known electrically transmitted character code, Morse code, introduced in the 1840s, used a system of four "symbols" (short signal, long signal, short space, long space) to generate codes of variable length.

## UTF-8

UTF-8, which is backward compatible with fixed-length ASCII.  
UTF-8 is the most widely used by a large margin, in part due to its backwards-compatibility with ASCII.
