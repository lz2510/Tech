# Page Replacement Algorithms :

- First In First Out (FIFO) –
This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.
- Optimal Page replacement –
In this algorithm, pages are replaced which would not be used for the longest duration of time in the future.
- Least Recently Used –
In this algorithm page will be replaced which is least recently used.
