## What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?

HTTP runs beyond the TCP and transfers the content with plaintext. Both client and server sides cannot verify each otherâ€™s identity.
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the HTTP that runs beyond SSL/TLS, which SSL/TLS running beyond the TCP. All the content transferred is encrypted.
Hence, the security of HTTPS is higher than HTTP, but HTTPS requires more resources than HTTP.
