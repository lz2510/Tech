# Microservices

## Data management

### Shared database

### Api composition

## Communication style

There are two basic messaging patterns that microservices can use to communicate with other microservices.  
1. Synchronous communication. In this pattern, a service calls an API that another service exposes, using a protocol such as HTTP or gRPC. This option is a synchronous messaging pattern because the caller waits for a response from the receiver.
2. Asynchronous message passing. In this pattern, a service sends message without waiting for a response, and one or more services process the message asynchronously.

### Http

HTTP power lies in getting the feedback (Response) right away.  
However HTTP Integration has few drawbacks:
- We need to depend on Service being up and running. In case service is down, we are unable to call it
- Service may be overloaded or simply working slowly, which may creates latency issues on our side
- It creates coupling between Services

### Kafka

- With Messaging we become independent of the state of Services around
- In Messaging, we are in fire-and-forget model. This means we only connect to the Postman (Message Broker) to send a message and the flow continues, no matter of the current Recipientâ€™s state.  
This set us free from the response times of other services.
- Messaging creates decoupled solution, where each Service may be in control of what they want to know (subscribe to).
