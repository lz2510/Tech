# complexity

## The average time complexity of different data structures

| Data structure | Access/Get at index/Indexing | Search| Insertion | Deletion |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Array |	O(1) | O(N) | O(N) |	O(N) |
| Linked list | O(N) |O(N) |O(1)	|O(1 )|
| Stack	| N/A | O(N)	|O(1)	|O(1) |
| Queue	| N/A | O(N)	|O(1)	|O(1) |
| Hash Table | N/A | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) |
| Binary Search Tree | N/A | O(log N) | O(log N) | O(log N) |

## Access/Get at index/Indexing vs Search

Only array Access/Get at index/Indexing and Search are different, others are the same.

## array vs linked list

Array is O(1) in access operation, insert and delete are O(n). Linked list access is O(n), insert and delet are O(1). Both search are O(n).
