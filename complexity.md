# complexity

## The average time complexity of different data structures

|Data structure|	Access/Get at index/Indexing|	Search|	Insertion|	Deletion
|--|--|--|--|--|
|Array|	O(1)|	O(N)|	O(N)|	O(N)
|Linked list|	O(N)|	O(N)|	O(1)|	O(1)

## Access/Get at index/Indexing vs Search

Only array Access/Get at index/Indexing and Search are different, others are the same.

## array vs linked list

Array is O(1) in access operation, other operations all are O(n). Linked list is O(1) in insertion and deletion.
