## array data structure

In computer science, an array is a data structure consisting of a collection of elements (values or variables), each identified by at least one array index or key. An array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula. The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array.

## list data type

In computer science, a list or sequence is an abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.

## associative array or map or dictionary

An array is one of the most powerful and flexible data types in PHP.

Arrays are ordered collections of items, called array elements, and are actually an implementation of ordered maps or more precisely hash tables.

Array types are often implemented by array data structures, but sometimes by other means, such as hash tables, linked lists, or search trees.

Array data types are most often implemented as array data structures: with the indices restricted to integer (or totally ordered) values.

PHP uses array-like syntax to implement a more general associative array semantics, and must therefore be implemented by a hash table or some other search data structure.

In PHP, all arrays can be associative.
