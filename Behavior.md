## Conflict Management

### Can you recall a time of conflict with a coworker?
Behavioral questions require you to describe how you acted in a real-life situation. Prospective employers ask this type of question to learn more about your personality. Past behavior often indicates how you would react in comparable future situations, so be sure to provide an example you are proud of or to explain the lessons you took away from the experience. It is important to emphasize the resolution that took place, as opposed to dwelling on the conflict itself.  

The STAR approach may prove helpful when answering this type of question. This acronym stands for:  
- Situation: Briefly explain the issue you were dealing with in a positive, constructive way.  
- Task: Describe your role in the situation.  
- Action: Discuss what you did to resolve or address the situation.  
- Result: Emphasize what you learned and how your actions had a positive outcome.  

Example: “I was working as a project manager on an IT project, and one technician was constantly late finishing tasks. When I approached him about it, he reacted defensively. I kept calm and acknowledged that the deadlines were challenging and asked how I could assist him in improving his performance. He calmed down and told me that he was involved in another project where he had to do tasks that were not in his job description. After a meeting with the other project manager, we came to a resolution that alleviated the technician’s workload. For the remainder of the project, the technician delivered great work.”
