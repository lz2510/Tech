Consider these examples to help you create your own response:

1. I start with a checklist of all tasks then sort them between urgent (priority) and important (secondary). If a task is unclear, I acquire more information before rating it. New tasks being assigned to the project are evaluated then added to the appropriate list.  

how to priority single task

- Task nearby deadline
2. If I encounter a difficult area, I ask for suggestions from others (team members, supervisor, manager) then re-evaluate the project and make changes, as needed.
3. If it is becoming clear the estimated deadline will not be met, I’ll evaluate the tasks then discuss the situation with my manager to make suggestions or recommendations.

### how to identify success in a project 

How do you measure the success of a software application you built?

This question can help the interviewer understand how you define success and what your goals are for a project. Use examples from past projects to explain how you measure success, and consider including specific metrics that show how your software applications helped businesses or organizations achieve their goals.

Example: “I measure the success of a software application I built by looking at the impact it had on the organization’s bottom line. For example, in my last role as a senior engineer, we were tasked with creating an online shopping platform that would allow customers to purchase products from multiple vendors using one interface. We created this system so that each vendor could use our platform to sell their products while also tracking customer data and sales information.”

### tell me about a time you made a mistake

There is a feature which get inventory file then backup. The file name is unique. So I design to move the file to another folder. Then one day there are two files with the same name. Moving to other folder failed because of permission.

I change the design to change name by adding timestamp when moving the file.

What I learnn is that when design a feature, we should always think about exception situation.

## Conflict Management

Conflict interview questions are questions designed to assess how you respond to and resolve conflict in the workplace. Employers ask these questions to get an idea of how well you work under and manage stress as well as your ability to professionally and respectfully resolve conflict with others. Here are five questions about conflict that an interviewer may ask:
1. How do you handle conflict?
2. Explain a situation when you had a conflict at work and how you handled it.
3. How do you handle disagreements when working as part of a team? Provide an example.
4. Explain a situation when you disagreed with your boss and how you handled it.
5. Explain a situation when you disagreed with a rule or policy and how you handled it.

### Can you recall a time of conflict with a coworker?

Behavioral questions require you to describe how you acted in a real-life situation. Prospective employers ask this type of question to learn more about your personality. Past behavior often indicates how you would react in comparable future situations, so be sure to provide an example you are proud of or to explain the lessons you took away from the experience. It is important to emphasize the resolution that took place, as opposed to dwelling on the conflict itself.  

The STAR approach may prove helpful when answering this type of question. This acronym stands for:  
- Situation: Briefly explain the issue you were dealing with in a positive, constructive way.  
- Task: Describe your role in the situation.  
- Action: Discuss what you did to resolve or address the situation.  
- Result: Emphasize what you learned and how your actions had a positive outcome.  

There was a cross team task. I ask the other team coworker to update code and db which they managed. He reacted defensively. I kept calm and talked with him. The reason was he thought it wasn't his responsibility. I arranaged a meeting with both teams managers to make the the responsibity clear. The result is positive.

### How do you handle disagreements when working as part of a team? Provide an example.

- Say my real thinking, advantage and disadvantage.
- Listen teammate thinking, advantage and disadvantage.
- Make an agreement in some way.
- ask more people how to think about it 
- ask manager for help 

When working on a team, conflict may arise between different people at any time. Your response to this question can demonstrate your ability to collaborate effectively with a variety of working styles.

When answering this question, explain how you respond to disagreements between multiple people and how you work to resolve them to accomplish the team goals. Provide an example from your experience that illustrates how you handle disagreements between team members. Try using the STAR method to form a thorough response. 
Example: “In my previous experience, I was working with a group to prepare a presentation for leadership. The group was responsible for conceptualizing an idea and presenting a project plan to implement the idea. We selected an idea and developed an action plan for completing the presentation. Two of the team members wanted to hold daily meetings to discuss the plan and progress. Other team members, including myself, disagreed with this approach because the team had a log to report task progress and completion. 

“As long as everyone knew their assigned tasks, we did not think we needed to divert time for meetings that would not move the project forward. We also thought these meetings would use valuable time needed to complete the project. Instead of starting an argument about the meetings, we gathered everyone together to explain their reasoning for their side. Eventually, we decided to hold a daily meeting that would last no more than ten minutes to provide short updates on task progress.”

### Explain a situation in which you disagreed with your manager and how you handled it.

Just as you could experience a conflict with team members, you may have also disagreed with a manager in the past. This question could determine how you respond to disagreements when it is with an authority figure and how it could impact your ability to perform assigned tasks. 

Your response can show your ability to follow instructions and how you approach a disagreement with your manager or supervisor. When answering this question, provide an honest example of when you disagreed with a supervisor and how you were able to resolve that conflict. 

Example: “When preparing data about the success of past projects to request funding for a new project in our department, a supervisor asked me to delete data records for projects that were less successful. I knew that deleting these records would skew the results and representation of our past performance. I expressed this concern to my supervisor, but she insisted that I remove the data. 

“After careful consideration, I decided to discuss the issue with the next level of management, which dismissed my concerns and supported the decision to remove the data. Ultimately, I removed data as directed, but I also changed the language in the report to clearly communicate that the reported data represented successful projects to ensure I accurately represented the information. I also documented the situation, including data records removed from reported results, in the event of questioning or an audit. 

“I understood my supervisor’s decision for the request, but I could not compromise my values. I tried to create a compromise in removing the data and adding the language. We did eventually receive funding for our project based on the reports.”

## Leadership

### How to Manage Conflict Between Your Team Members

#### Types of Workplace Conflict

Generally, workplace conflicts fall into two categories:

- Personality conflict or disagreements between individuals. These clashes are driven and perpetuated by emotions such as anger, stress and frustration.
- Substantive conflict is tangible and task-related, like the decisions leaders make, the performance of a team member, or your company's direction.

#### What Causes Conflict at Work?

Some of the most common causes of workplace conflict are:

- Unclear responsibilities. Some team members may feel they do more work than others, or resent those who seem to have fewer responsibilities. Blame and frustration can build due to duplicated work or unfinished tasks.
- Competition for resources. Time, money, materials, equipment, and skillsets are finite resources. Competition for them can lead to conflict.
- Different interests. People may focus on personal or departmental goals over organizational ones. Or be held up and frustrated by others who they rely on to do their jobs effectively.

#### How to address
1. Speak to team members individually.
2. Bring people together.
3. Ask the wider team for ideas.
4. Draw up a plan.
5. Follow up.
