# CSRF

## Description

CSRF belongs to broken access control.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated. With a little help of social engineering (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker’s choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

The target site cannot distinguish between a legitimate request and a forged one, and may perform actions on behalf of the user, such as changing their password, transferring funds, or deleting data.

## How to prevent

IMPORTANT: Remember that Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) can defeat all CSRF mitigation techniques!

1. See the OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet for detailed guidance on how to prevent XSS flaws.
2. First, check if your framework has built-in CSRF protection and use it
3. If an API-driven site can't use \<form\> tags, consider using custom request headers.
4. SameSite Cookie Attribute can be used for session cookies but be careful to NOT set a cookie specifically for a domain. This action introduces a security vulnerability because all subdomains of that domain will share the cookie, and this is particularly an issue if a subdomain has a CNAME to domains not in your control.
5. User Interaction-Based CSRF Defense. Like login to platform to grant. OAuth2
6. Do not use GET requests for state changing operations.

### Token-Based Mitigation

The synchronizer token pattern is one of the most popular and recommended methods to mitigate CSRF.

#### Use Built-In Or Existing CSRF Implementations for CSRF Protection

Since synchronizer token defenses are built into many frameworks, find out if your framework has CSRF protection available by default before you build a custom token generating system. 

##### CSRF Tokens & SPAs in Laravel

If you are building a SPA that is utilizing Laravel as an API backend, you should consult the Laravel Sanctum documentation for information on authenticating with your API and protecting against CSRF vulnerabilities.

https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/csrf  
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sanctum  

#### Synchronizer Token Pattern

CSRF tokens should be generated on the server-side and they should be generated only once per user session or each request. Because the time range for an attacker to exploit the stolen tokens is minimal for per-request tokens, they are more secure than per-session tokens. However, using per-request tokens may result in usability concerns.

For example, the "Back" button browser capability can be hindered by a per-request token as the previous page may contain a token that is no longer valid. In this case, interaction with a previous page will result in a CSRF false positive security event on the server-side. If per-session token implementations occur after the initial generation of a token, the value is stored in the session and is used for each subsequent request until the session expires.

When a client issues a request, the server-side component must verify the existence and validity of the token in that request and compare it to the token found in the user session. The request should be rejected if that token was not found within the request or the value provided does not match the value within the user session. Additional actions such as logging the event as a potential CSRF attack in progress should also be considered.

CSRF tokens should be:

- Unique per user session.
- Secret
- Unpredictable (large random value generated by a secure method).
CSRF tokens prevent CSRF because without a CSRF token, an attacker cannot create valid requests to the backend server.

##### Transmissing CSRF Tokens in Synchronized Patterns¶

The CSRF token can be transmitted to the client as part of a response payload, such as a HTML or JSON response, then it can be transmitted back to the server as a hidden field on a form submission or via an AJAX request as a custom header value or part of a JSON payload. a CSRF token should not be transmitted in a cookie for synchronized patterns. A CSRF token must not be leaked in the server logs or in the URL. GET requests can potentially leak CSRF tokens at several locations, such as the browser history, log files, network utilities that log the first line of a HTTP request, and Referer headers if the protected site links to an external site.

For example:

        <form action="/transfer.do" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="CSRFToken" value="OWY4NmQwODE4ODRjN2Q2NTlhMmZlYWEwYzU1YWQwMTVhM2JmNGYxYjJiMGI4MjJjZDE1ZDZMGYwMGEwOA==">
        [...]
        </form>
        
Since requests with custom headers are automatically subject to the same-origin policy, it is more secure to insert the CSRF token in a custom HTTP request header via JavaScript than adding a CSRF token in the hidden field form parameter.

#### ALTERNATIVE: Using A Double-Submit Cookie Pattern

If maintaining the state for CSRF token on the server is problematic, you can use an alternative technique known as the Double Submit Cookie pattern. This technique is easy to implement and is stateless. There are different ways to implement this technique, where the naive pattern is the most commonly used variation.

##### Signed Double-Submit Cookie (RECOMMENDED)

The most secure implementation of the Double Submit Cookie pattern is the Signed Double-Submit Cookie, which uses a secret key known only to the server. This ensures that an attacker cannot create and inject their own, known, CSRF token into the victim's authenticated session. The system's tokens should be secured by hashing or encrypting them.

We strongly recommend that you use the Hash-based Message Authentication (HMAC) algorithm because it is less computationally intensive than encrypting and decrypting the cookie. You should also bind the CSRF token with the user's current session to even further enhance security.

###### EMPLOYING HMAC CSRF TOKENS

To generate HMAC CSRF tokens (with a session-dependent user value), the system must have:

**A session-dependent value that changes with each login session.** This value should only be valid for the entirety of the users authenticated session. Avoid using static values like the user's email or ID, as they are not secure (1 | 2 | 3). It's worth noting that updating the CSRF token too frequently, such as for each request, is a misconception that assumes it adds substantial security while actually harming the user experience (1). For example, you could choose one of the following session-dependent values:
- The server-side session ID (e.g. PHP or ASP.NET).
- A random value (e.g. UUID) within a JWT that changes every time a JWT is created.
**A secret cryptographic key Not to confuse with the random value from the naive implementation.** This value is used to generate the HMAC hash. Ideally, store this key as an environment variable.
**A random value for anti-collision purposes.** Generate a random value (preferably cryptographically random) to ensure that consecutive calls within the same second do not produce the same hash (1).

**Should Timestamps be Included in CSRF Tokens for Expiration?**

It's a common misconception to include timestamps as a value to specify the CSRF token expiration time. A CSRF Token is not an access token. They are used to verify the authenticity of requests throughout a session, using session information. A new session should generate a new token (1).

###### PSEUDO-CODE FOR IMPLEMENTING HMAC CSRF TOKENS

Below is an example in pseudo-code that demonstrates the implementation steps described above:

        // Gather the values
        secret = readEnvironmentVariable("CSRF_SECRET") // HMAC secret key
        sessionID = session.sessionID // Current authenticated user session
        randomValue = cryptographic.randomValue() // Cryptographic random value
        
        // Create the CSRF Token
        message = sessionID + "!" + randomValue // HMAC message payload
        hmac = hmac("SHA256", secret, message) // Generate the HMAC hash
        csrfToken = hmac + "." + message // Combine HMAC hash with message to generate the token. The plain message is required to later authenticate it against its HMAC hash
        
        // Store the CSRF Token in a cookie
        response.setCookie("csrf_token=" + csrfToken + "; Secure) // Set Cookie without HttpOnly flag

https://medium.com/@kaviru.mihisara/double-submit-cookie-pattern-820fc97e51f2  
https://medium.com/cross-site-request-forgery-csrf/double-submit-cookie-pattern-65bb71d80d9f  

The CSRF token can be transmitted to the client as part of a response payload, such as a HTML or JSON response, then it can be transmitted back to the server as a hidden field on a form submission or via an AJAX request as a custom header value or part of a JSON payload. a CSRF token should not be transmitted in a cookie for synchronized patterns. A CSRF token must not be leaked in the server logs or in the URL. 


Double submitting cookies is defined as sending a random value in both a cookie and as a request parameter, with the server verifying if the cookie value and request value are equal.

When a user logs into the site, a session is created, and the session ID is set as a cookie in the browser. At the same time, another cookie is set for the CSRF token
Next, when the user submits a secure form, this token is extracted from the cookie and is set as a hidden input field in the HTML. This cookie cannot be set as Http Only as the client-side script requires to access this because in this scenario, the token endpoint does not exist, and the server has no record of the generated token for this session.
The server will validate the token sent as a form parameter against the cookie value and authorize the action to be completed. A cross origin attacker cannot read any data sent from the server or modify cookie values, per the same-origin policy.

##### Naive Double-Submit Cookie Pattern (DISCOURAGED)

##### Employing Custom Request Headers for AJAX/API

Both the synchronizer token and the double-submit cookie are used to prevent forgery of form data, but they can be tricky to implement and degrade usability. Many modern web applications do not use \<form\> tags to submit data. A user-friendly defense that is particularly well suited for AJAX or API endpoints is the use of a custom request header. No token is needed for this approach.

Caveat: Should a browser bug allow custom HTTP headers, it could compromise your security. Although unlikely, it is prudent to consider this in your threat model. Implementing CSRF tokens adds additional layer of defence and gives developers more control over security of the application.

In this pattern, the client appends a custom header to requests that require CSRF protection. The header can be any arbitrary key-value pair, as long as it does not conflict with existing headers.

        X-YOURSITE-CSRF-PROTECTION=1

When handling the request, the API checks for the existence of this header. If the header does not exist, the backend rejects the request as potential forgery. This approach has several advantages:

- UI changes are not required
- no server state is introduced to track tokens

This defense relies on the CORS preflight mechanism which sends an OPTIONS request to verify CORS compliance with the destination server. All modern browsers designate requests with custom headers as "to be preflighted". When the API verifies that the custom header is there, you know that the request must have been preflighted if it came from a browser.

When a \<form\> tag is used to submit data, it sends a "simple" request that browsers do not designate as "to be preflighted". These "simple" requests introduce risk of CSRF because browsers permit them to be sent to any origin. If your application uses <form> tags to submit data anywhere in your client, you will still need to protect them with alternate approaches described in this document such as tokens.

##### Custom Headers and CORS

Cookies are not set on cross-origin requests (CORS) by default. To enable cookies on an API, you will set Access-Control-Allow-Credentials=true. The browser will reject any response that includes Access-Control-Allow-Origin=* if credentials are allowed. To allow CORS requests, but protect against CSRF, you need to make sure the server only whitelists a few select origins that you definitively control via the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. Any cross-origin request from an allowed domain will be able to set custom headers.

As an example, you might configure your backend to allow CORS with cookies from http://www.yoursite.com and http://mobile.yoursite.com, so that the only possible preflight responses are:

        Access-Control-Allow-Origin=http://mobile.yoursite.com
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials=true
        
or

        Access-Control-Allow-Origin=http://www.yoursite.com
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials=true
        
A less secure configuration would be to configure your backend server to allow CORS from all subdomains of your site using a regular expression. If an attacker is able to take over a subdomain (not uncommon with cloud services) your CORS configuration would allow them to bypass the same origin policy and forge a request with your custom header.

### Defense In Depth Techniques

#### SameSite (Cookie Attribute)

SameSite is a cookie attribute (similar to HTTPOnly, Secure etc.) which aims to mitigate CSRF attacks. It is defined in RFC6265bis. This attribute helps the browser decide whether to send cookies along with cross-site requests. Possible values for this attribute are Lax, Strict, or None.

The Strict value will prevent the cookie from being sent by the browser to the target site in all cross-site browsing context, even when following a regular link. For example, if a GitHub-like website uses the Strict value, a logged-in GitHub user who tries to follow a link to a private GitHub project posted on a corporate discussion forum or email, the user will not be able to access the project because GitHub will not receive a session cookie. Since a bank website would not allow any transactional pages to be linked from external sites, so the Strict flag would be most appropriate for banks.

If a website wants to maintain a user's logged-in session after the user arrives from an external link, SameSite's default Lax value provides a reasonable balance between security and usability. If the GitHub scenario above uses a Lax value instead, the session cookie would be allowed when following a regular link from an external website while blocking it in CSRF-prone request methods such as POST. Only cross-site-requests that are allowed in Lax mode have top-level navigations and use safe HTTP methods.

For more details on the SameSite values, check the following section from the rfc.

Example of cookies using this attribute:

    Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=xxxxx; SameSite=Strict
    Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=xxxxx; SameSite=Lax

#### Using Standard Headers to Verify Origin

There are two steps to this mitigation method, both of which examine an HTTP request header value:

- Determine the origin that the request is coming from (source origin). Can be done via Origin or Referer headers.
- Determining the origin that the request is going to (target origin).

At server-side, we verify if both of them match. If they do, we accept the request as legitimate (meaning it's the same origin request) and if they don't, we discard the request (meaning that the request originated from cross-domain). Reliability on these headers comes from the fact that they cannot be altered programmatically as they fall under forbidden headers list, meaning that only the browser can set them.

##### Identifying Source Origin (via Origin/Referer Header)

###### CHECKING THE ORIGIN HEADER

If the Origin header is present, verify that its value matches the target origin. Unlike the referer, the Origin header will be present in HTTP requests that originate from an HTTPS URL.

###### CHECKING THE REFERER HEADER IF ORIGIN HEADER IS NOT PRESENT

If the Origin header is not present, verify that the hostname in the Referer header matches the target origin. This method of CSRF mitigation is also commonly used with unauthenticated requests, such as requests made prior to establishing a session state, which is required to keep track of a synchronization token.

In both cases, make sure the target origin check is strong. For example, if your site is example.org make sure example.org.attacker.com does not pass your origin check (i.e, match through the trailing / after the origin to make sure you are matching against the entire origin).

If neither of these headers are present, you can either accept or block the request. We recommend blocking. Alternatively, you might want to log all such instances, monitor their use cases/behavior, and then start blocking requests only after you get enough confidence.

##### Identifying the Target Origin

Generally, it's not always easy to determine the target origin. You are not always able to simply grab the target origin (i.e., its hostname and port #) from the URL in the request, because the application server is frequently sitting behind one or more proxies. This means that the original URL can be different from the URL the app server actually receives. However, if your application server is directly accessed by its users, then using the origin in the URL is fine and you're all set.

If you are behind a proxy, there are a number of options to consider.

**Configure your application to simply know its target origin**: Since it is your application, you can find its target origin and set that value in some server configuration entry. This would be the most secure approach as its defined server side, so it is a trusted value. However, this might be problematic to maintain if your application is deployed in many places, e.g., dev, test, QA, production, and possibly multiple production instances. Setting the correct value for each of these situations might be difficult, but if you can do it via some central configuration and provide your instances the ability to grab the value from it, that's great! (Note: Make sure the centralized configuration store is maintained securely because major part of your CSRF defense depends on it.)

**Use the Host header value**: If you want your application to find its own target so it doesn't have to be configured for each deployed instance, we recommend using the Host family of headers. The Host header is meant to contain the target origin of the request. But, if your app server is sitting behind a proxy, the Host header value is most likely changed by the proxy to the target origin of the URL behind the proxy, which is different than the original URL. This modified Host header origin won't match the source origin in the original Origin or Referer headers.

**Use the X-Forwarded-Host header value**: To avoid the possibility that the proxy will alter the host header, you can use another header called X-Forwarded-Host to contain the original Host header value the proxy received. Most proxies will pass along the original Host header value in the X-Forwarded-Host header. So the value in X-Forwarded-Host is likely to be the target origin value that you need to compare to the source origin in the Origin or Referer header.

###### http header Host vs x-forwarded-host

For the need for 'x-forwarded-host', I can think of a virtual hosting scenario where there are several internal hosts (internal network) and a reverse proxy sitting in between those hosts and the internet. If the requested host is part of the internal network, the requested host resolves to the reverse proxy IP and the web browser sends the request to the reverse proxy. This reverse proxy finds the appropriate internal host and forwards the request sent by the client to this host. In doing so, the reverse proxy changes the host field to match the internal host and sets the x-forward-host to the actual host requested by the client. More details on reverse proxy can be found in this wikipedia page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy

If you use a front-end service like Apigee as the front-end to your APIs, you will need something like X-FORWARDED-HOST to understand what hostname was used to connect to the API, because Apigee gets configured with whatever your backend DNS is, nginx and your app stack only see the Host header as your backend DNS name, not the hostname that was called in the first place.

#### Using Cookies with Host Prefixes to Identify Origins

Another solution for this problem is using Cookie Prefixes for cookies with CSRF tokens. If cookies have __Host- prefixes e.g. Set-Cookie: __Host-token=RANDOM; path=/; Secure then each cookie:

- Cannot be (over)written from another subdomain.
- Must have the path of /.
- Must be marked as Secure (i.e, cannot be sent over unencrypted HTTP).

## CSRF vs XSS

### How are CSRF and XSS different?

CSRF and XSS are different in several ways. First, CSRF relies on the user's browser to send a request to the target site, while XSS relies on the user's browser to execute code from the attacker's site. Second, CSRF does not require the attacker to compromise the target site, while XSS does. Third, CSRF does not affect the user's browser directly, while XSS does. 

### How are CSRF and XSS similar?

CSRF and XSS are similar in some ways. First, both attacks aim to exploit the user's trust and session with the target site. Second, both attacks can cause serious damage to the user's data and privacy, as well as the reputation and functionality of the target site. Third, both attacks can be performed by sending a link or an email to the user, or embedding the malicious code or request in a third-party site or application.
