# Regular Expression

## Character classes

The character class is the most basic regex concept after a literal match. It makes one small sequence of characters match a larger set of characters. 
For example, [A-Z] could stand for any uppercase letter in the English alphabet, and \d could mean any digit. Character classes apply to both POSIX levels.

Different Regular Expression Engines
A regular expression “engine” is a piece of software that can process regular expressions, trying to match the pattern to the given string. Usually, the engine is part of a larger application and you do not access the engine directly. Rather, the application invokes it for you when needed, making sure the right regular expression is applied to the right file or data.

As usual in the software world, different regular expression engines are not fully compatible with each other. The syntax and behavior of a particular engine is called a regular expression flavor. This tutorial covers all the popular regular expression flavors, including Perl, PCRE, PHP, .NET, Java, JavaScript, XRegExp, VBScript, Python, Ruby, Delphi, R, Tcl, POSIX, and many others. 
The tutorial alerts you when these flavors require different syntax or show different behavior.
