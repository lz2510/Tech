# unit test

## how to make sure code is good engough and don't introduce new bug

- use code quality tool
- follow best pritice
- when fix a bug. write a test that reproduces the bug. then fix the bug.
- use automaticed test tool to generate test coverage, if lower than coverage rate, then reject.
when develop new feature, write unit and functional test.

## best pritice

1. Tests should have no I/O operations

Main reasoning: I/O is slow and unreliable.

2. Tests should be concise and meaningful

Main reasoning: tests are a form of documentation. Keep them clean, short and readable.

3. A test should not depend on another

Main reasoning: a test should be able to run and succeed in any order.

4. Always inject dependencies

Main reasoning: mocking global state is terrible, not being able to mock dependencies at all makes it impossible to test a feature.

## intergration test

Luckily for us Laravel 5 provides two useful methods to solve this problem:
* Database Transactions
Each time you run a test, Laravel will cleverly wrap the database calls in a transaction, so when the test finishes the transaction rolls back, leaving the database in its previous state.
* Switch to a test database
You can set up an alternative database to use when Laravel switches to a test environment. However you still have to make sure that this database remains in the same state between each test iteration, otherwise it could affect the results. Remember: tests must be performed in isolation.
However thereâ€™s a handy solution that elegantly solves this problem, and at the same time it speeds up the execution of the tests: setup a SQLite database in memory, so when the tests are over, it will simply be destroyed.
Warning: be sure to avoid the use of MySQL native functions in your code, because in most of the cases they not work in SQLite.

## test database

1. in-memory sqlite 
2. file-based sqlite 
3. mysql for test (if code has sql native function)
