## concepts

### bounded context

### entities

An entity is a "thing" in your system. Entities have both an identity and a lifecycle.

Entities are a combination of data and behavior, like a user or a product.

Dependency can be inject to a method. Or can use domain service.

### value objects

### aggerate

### domain service vs application service
