# Design Pattern

## classification

Design patterns had originally been categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on what kind of problem they solve. 

Creational patterns provide the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way. 

Structural patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. 

Finally, behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns.
