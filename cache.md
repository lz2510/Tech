# Cache

## Invalidate caches appropriately

When data is updated, the corresponding cache entries should be invalidated to ensure that clients receive the latest data. 

One common approach to cache invalidation is to use a time-based expiration, where cache entries are invalidated after a fixed time period. 

Another approach is to use a "write-through" cache, where updates to the data are also written to the cache to ensure that the cache is always up to date.
