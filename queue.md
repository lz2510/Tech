# Queue

It is an abstract data type. It is an ordered list of objects that follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle.

## Uses

- **Breadth-first search** uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next.
- **Web servers** use queues to manage requestsâ€”page requests get fulfilled in the order they're received.
- **Processes** wait in the CPU scheduler's queue for their turn to run.
