# System Design Trade-offs

## latency vs throughput

Improving latency and throughput often involves different strategies, as optimizing for one can sometimes impact the other. However, there are several techniques that can enhance both metrics:

How to Improve Latency
1. Optimize Network Routes: Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to serve content from locations geographically closer to the user. This reduces the distance data must travel, decreasing latency.
2. Upgrade Hardware: Faster processors, more memory, and quicker storage (like SSDs) can reduce processing time.
3. Database Optimization: Use indexing, optimized queries, and in-memory databases to reduce data access and processing time.
4. Code Optimization: Optimize algorithms and remove unnecessary computations to speed up execution.

How to Improve Throughput
1. Scale Horizontally: Add more servers to handle increased load. This is often more effective than vertical scaling (upgrading the capacity of a single server).
2. Implement Caching: Cache frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the need for repeated data processing.
3. Optimize Database Performance: Ensure efficient data storage and retrieval. This may include techniques like partitioning and sharding.
4. Asynchronous Processing: Use asynchronous processes for tasks that donâ€™t need to be completed immediately.

Conclusion
Low latency is crucial for applications requiring fast response times, while high throughput is vital for systems dealing with large volumes of data.
